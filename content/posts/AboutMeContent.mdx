👋 Hey, I'm Karnell Schultz. I'm a self taught Software Engineer living and working in Stockholm Sweden 🇸🇪.
In 2015 after 8.5 years of being a tow truck driver, I successfully made a career change into the tech industry.
However, even after making the career change it'd be another five years before I landed my deam job of being a Softwear Engineer.

This site is intended to be a central location where I share my projects, thoughts and experiences in tech, and a place where I try out new technology.
My hope is to create a place where I'm able to inspire others who are from 'non-triditional', like myself. I also hope that I'm able to offer content that people find usefull.

I'm orginally from [Atlanta](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta), 🦅🇺🇸🦅
and love all things [1996 Olympics](https://www.olympic.org/atlanta-1996).
In my freetime I enjoy writing resturant reviews on Google, film 📷 photography, cooking, beer, coffee, nature things, listening to music, 90's thriller films, ect. . .

I &nbs;❤️ Javascript and the community around it. Here are some of the technoligies I'm interested in at the moment:

- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
