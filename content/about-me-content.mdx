## About me

I'm a self taught Software Engineer living and working in Stockholm Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª.
In 2015 after 9 years of being a
[tow truck](https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/08/aaa-tow-truck.jpg?quality=60&strip=color&w=1024)
driver, I successfully made a career change into the tech industry
doing tech support at [Mailchimp](mailchimp.com).
However, even after making the career change it'd be another few
years before I landed my deam job of being a Software Engineer at Paypal.

I'm orginally from [Atlanta](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta),
home of the [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.),
[1996 Olympics](https://www.olympic.org/atlanta-1996), and [Young Thug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Thug).

In my freetime I enjoy writing resturant reviews on Google, film ðŸ“· photography,
cooking, beer, coffee, nature things, listening to music, 90's
thriller films and so on.

Here are a few things that have my interest at the moment.
