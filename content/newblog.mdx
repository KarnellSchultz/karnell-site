# A New Blog? What is this, 2006?

## Why blog?

Over the past year or so I've spent an incredible amount of time learning about web technologies. I've spent countless hours reading üìñ [JavaScript books](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), listening to [coding Podcasts](https://syntax.fm/), watching [coding üöÇ Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) ,and reading random tech bloggers posts. With those last three having the added benefit of being totally free! It's amazing how many people are sharing their experiences in the tech. I'm super grateful for it all.

After taking in this content for a while there was one common thread that stuck out to me. While the people making the content seemed super knowledgeable about what they were presenting about. They'd often talk about teaching as an extension of their own learning. I thought this was a pretty cool idea, but I never really felt like I was *good enough* to share anything I knew. Or I figured that there was no place for me to add valuable content. It all seemed like it had been covered already. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è When ‚ö°Ô∏èInspo ‚ö°Ô∏è Strikes ‚ö°Ô∏è

In February of 2020 I was listening to a [EggHead.io](https://egghead.io/podcasts/switching-careers-and-learning-in-public-with-tania-rascia) Podcast (about min 13:00) with one of my favorite bloggers [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/). On this podcast they talk about how useful the blog was in her career as a recruiting tool as a learner(amongst lots of other interesting topics). They even went as far as saying something like *"It's a good idea to start a blog" or* "you totally start a blog" at least that's what I remember hearing. 

They also spoke about the value of the mindset of a newbie teaching. Saying how it's difficult for an expert to think about topics in the mind of a newbie. Therefore, a new person in some cases was just as good at teaching these things.üí°

After hearing this I knew I had to start my own blog. I realized that even as a newbie I valuable insights to share about my experiences in tech. Also, I knew that the process of having to map out what I'm learning to create blogs would help me to cement my learnings. And, even if I forgot something I learned previously, I would not have notes to look back on. I saw nothing but positive reasons to start a blog of my own üòÖ.

## Action ‚ûï Inspo

Feeling full of blogging inspiration I started this blog. I want to keep it pretty small and maintainable so that it does not become a burden on my time. 

I plan on writing a full post about the technical aspects of building and designing my blog soon.
