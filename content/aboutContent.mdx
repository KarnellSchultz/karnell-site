# About me

I'm a software devloper living in Stockholm 🇸🇪.

I ❤️ Javascript and the community around it. Here are some of the technoligies I'm interested in at the moment:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React

I'm orginally from [Atlanta](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta), 🦅🇺🇸🦅 
and love all things [1996 Olympics](https://www.olympic.org/atlanta-1996).
In my freetime I enjoy watching movies and cooking.
