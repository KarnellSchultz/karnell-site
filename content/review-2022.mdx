## 2022(and some of 2023) year in review

Better late than never I suppose. Here we go with the 2022 year in
review.

### Interests

- React
- TypeScript
- Next.Js
- Go
- Raycast

### [KarnellSchultz.com](http://KarnellSchultz.com) Updates

Not much going on here. Updated my site to the newest versions of
Next, I like to keep this site on the cutting edge even if it’s far
from being optimal. Getting to learn about the new React paradigms has
been pretty fun. I love having the chance to play with the latest and
greatest stuff here on my blog.

### Learning

- Go - Learning has helped me get better at JS. I’d like to write more
  about that later this year. I still have a lot to learn and I’m
  still searching for a project to build using Go.

- JavaScript - Yes that’s right, I’m still learning JS. Even after
  using JS for several years, there is still a lot to learn.
  Specifically I’ve had a focus on performance and how the language
  itself works. Feels like I’m reaching new levels of using the
  language and that’s a fun feeling.

- Astro - Pretty amazing framework. Going to try to build as much as I
  can with Astro this year. Currently working on some projects for
  friends of mine where Astro is the perfect tool for the job.

### Entertainment

- Watching a ton of
  [ThePrimagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) and
  [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) these days.
- I think [Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/@jherr) is still
  top dog when it comes to creating content that I find useful and can
  learn from.
- [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wZp4jV4cQ) Love
  checking out their videos to get inspo for things I'm working on and
  just to keep up with all the crazy things people are making around
  the web.
- [Coding in Public](https://www.youtube.com/@CodinginPublic) is
  pretty new to me but I really enjoy their content.

### Work

Quit my job at PayPal in 2022. Started working at a Startup called
Hedvig. Got laid off from Hedvig 9 months later. Starting a new job at
a Swedish sports store called XXL All Sports Untied in a few weeks.
It's been a bit of wild ride, but I've learned so much and I'm pretty
happy about where I've ended up.

### Conclusion

In many ways 2023 has already been a pretty challenging year. Being
laid off for the first time ever while living in a country in which
I'm not from is pretty scary. But with summer around the corner and
the start of a new job I'm filled with new hope and energy to take on
the rest of the year.
