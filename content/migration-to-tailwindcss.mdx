# Migration to Tailwindcss

I few weeks ago I finally decided to rip Styled Components out of my site and replace it with TailwindCss.

## Why no more Styled Components?

Styled Components was super cool when I first started learning web development. It was **********the way to write modern css********** in a react app at the time. As great as that was I think Styled Components and other projects like it are no longer worth starting a new project with. 

it was nice to have scoped css and was a major improvement on having a single css stylesheet. But going into 2023 I don‚Äôt think the goods are good enough. 

There is a interesting article [here](https://dev.to/srmagura/why-were-breaking-up-wiht-css-in-js-4g9b) by a maintainer of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) on why they‚Äôre ‚Äúbreaking up with styled components‚Äù. They go into detail on the good and the bad a bit more than I will. 

## Tailwind let‚Äôs go! üöÄ

From the old ***hot thing*** to the new hot thing. The forceable future seems to be with Tailwind or libraries that build on the DX of Tailwind. I like tailwind because you have to know css to use it correctly. You‚Äôre learning css while using Tailwind. it does not slow down your application. 

Along with the migration to Tailwind I made some design changes on my site that I‚Äôve been thinking of doing for a little while now.

For now I‚Äôm happy with Tailwind. More redesigning coming soon :-)
